# ETL_Pipeline-Airflow-
A functional ETL pipeline designed with apache airflow
This pipeline is designed to run on macOS or linux-based systems.
I created this pipeline after coming across Apache Airflow and wanting to understand how it works in more detail, with the best way to do that being to actually work with it in a practical scenario.
You can clone this repo to your own machine and follow the steps to replicate my pipeline, break and fiddle with the code. I may come back to it in future to add AWS capability to the pipeline.
